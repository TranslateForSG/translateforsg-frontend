        <p>
          This web app started from the work of Sudesna Roy Chowdhury's Website. The website had been a
          treasure trove of translations from the Singaporean Bengali community.
          <a href="https://meditranslate.org/?thanksFrom=TranslateForSG"
          >Medi-translate</a>
          and other communities stepped up to drive the efforts to many languages.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4">Engineering Sprint</h3>
        <p>Ani joins the efforts. He starts building up TranslateForSG to cater to a wider and more diverse community of Singapore residents;
            speaking different langauges and dialects. AI-enabled translations and speech was used before volunteers jumped in. The web app 
            was made mobile-friendly and easy-to-use. Translations were centralized.</p>
        <br />
